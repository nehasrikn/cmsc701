# CMSC 701 Project 3: Evaluating two different AMQs 

> What language have you written your solution in? <br>

My code is written in Python.

> What resources did you consult in working on this assignment?

I used this [Bloom filter implementation](https://github.com/KenanHanke/rbloom) and [this MPHF](https://github.com/dib-lab/pybbhash)


All the code to experiment and to run the files is in the main functions of all the Python files. You'll need Python 3.9.
