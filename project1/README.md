> What language have you written your solution in? <br>

My code is written in Java.

> What resources did you consult in working on this assignment?

I used this [implementation](https://github.com/v-v/karkkainen-sanders/tree/master/code/java/Bioinformatika/src) of the suffix array in this assignment. In order to stay consistent with their API, my code that reads in FASTA files is similar to their implementation.
